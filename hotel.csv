Pesan kamar biasa eh dapet upgrade dari hotel karena bawa bayi. Cuma awalnya agak repot aja karena salah kamar tapi semua bisa teratasi langsung sat set sat set. Dengan harga yang murah dan fasilitas dan pelayanan yang oke, next kalau ke Bali dan ada rencana ke Nusa Penida bisa nginap di sini. Recommended kalau cari hotel budget dan kalau mau ke Nusa Penida bisa naik motor 10-15 menit. Tetap di pertahankan ya pelayanannya üëç",abian harmony hotel,Bali

Windy R. A. P.,6.7,15 Oct 2019,"I took the large room (superior) in 2nd floor, I came late night around 12.30 pm, the lightening in the 2nd floor was not enough I think so it kinda make me scare a bit as I came very midnight. The room was on the corner and very spacious but also very empty, there were no big mirror or sofa, so I feel like there is a big hole in this room. The household furnishing and bathroom design is quite old style I think. My room has a big balcony also which is nice and you can dry your clothes there as it faces the sun, this balcony also was huge, I think about 4-5 people can be up there. Breakfast was very very basic also I think, if you are in a hunger mode I supposed you will need to find extra food outside. The staffs were helpful and friendly, and the location was very strategic I like it. Nevertheless although I am not very happy with my room because I feel hollow and a little bit spooky I will not protest much as the price is also cheap, you get what you paid I must say. I took this also because I had to came midnight and in the morning checkout again for an event so I do not want to waste such money for a short time stay. Maybe try the other room and it will be better!",abian harmony hotel,Bali
Loisa M. P.,8.6,02 Oct 2019,"We, family of 4 enjoyed staying here, they are some good and not that good things. The good side are, big family room to accommodate the 4 of us, for breakfast they'll give you menu to choose from and some buffet (not much but enough). They changed the menus every Thursday. Not very good: the room is quite old, some leaking pipe and during our stay there the repairment took place, very noisy and dusty.

Qissera E. T.,9.4,08 Apr 2018,"I stayed in Abian Harmony for 3 nights.
The location was perfect, very strategic, easy to be found, near to the beach.
The reception was friendly and warm. 
They upgraded my room, from standard superior to family room so spacious with balcony. 
They have several bikes that can be used for free, super fun way to explore Sanur.
The only thing is that since I guess the hotel itself is not new and has lack of maintenance somehow you can smell the unpleasant odor of an old hotel. The towels are clean but smell. Also the bathroom smells so bad! I believe they need to renew the structure.",abian harmony hotel,Bali

Candrika A. T.,8.6,14 Jan 2018,"Pros: Cheap. Room is clean and spacious. Staffs are helpful and friendly. Cons: The towel is dirty and greyish. The hotel is only 10 mins walk from the beach, however it's not one of those pretty beaches you can spend hours to sit/ suntanning/ enjoy. The shore line is near with a lot of boats parking. Didn't see any tourist sitting or playing on the beach. Spend two nights in the hotel and have to go to the reception three times because the room key wasn't working. Happened to get a room at level 3 with no lift, so need to take a lift to level 2 and climb the stair. Dark corridor. Conclusion: It's pretty decent for the price I paid for the room. If you need a space just to spend the night, it's the right place. But if you are for holiday, wants a bit more extra comfort, plan to spend a lot of time enjoying the beach, I'd recommend to look for other place.",abian harmony hotel,Bali

With low prices and good facilities and services, next time you go to Bali and have plans to go to Nusa Penida, you can stay here.

Agustina N. S.,6.5,18 May 2022,"I like the motif of the bed, it has batik. Paintings are also not living creatures. Location close to the beach. Enough with the walk. The drawback is that the toilet water is dead, when you first started using it, luckily the shower water was still alive, you can still use it. Too bad I couldn't brush my teeth and toothpaste because I forgot to bring it too. Lots of ants, and the balcony area is quite dirty. The choice between awesome and unsatisfying is confusing to me.

Tapi di Anvaya semuanya terbayarkan, kamar yang saya pesan untuk 2 malam - premiere suite, tapi sedikit agak kecewa di awal karena sudah di note kan untuk minta kamar high floor tapi ternyata malah full. Semua staff friendly, baik dari petugas security paling depan hingga security yang di bagian jaga pantai belakang. All services are good. Kamar tidur juga bersih, untuk saya & anak yang hidungnya sensitif debu ternyata kamar kita bersih, karpet-karpet juga bersih, termasuk bantal-bantal yang di sofa. Kamar mandi bersih, handuk juga bersih tidak kumal dan bau. Untuk sarapan, sangat amat banyak varian menunya. Kalo soal rasa ya standard lidah masing-masing,. Tapi kalau saya pribadi suda cukup bagus. Cuma untuk makan malam yang saya pesan ke kamar itu sop ayam & fish n chip semuanya terasa asin seperti ketumpahan garam, mungkin ke depannya bisa diperbaiki. Well, ini review saya tinggal selama 2 malam di sini sama keluarga. Sangat recommend untuk bawa keluarga kesini. Sure, will be back here in couple months lagi sama keluarga.

Thank you so much. But segala apresiasi saya hilang setelah saya sarapan pagi ini. Saya berekspektasi tinggi dan total fail. Menu sedikit dan sekelas Aston rasa rata-rata 6,5/10. Dan yang paling buruk saya sarapan jam 7 pagi dan saya memanggil chef yang bertanggung jawab untuk mengecek makanan di sana tumis sayuran basi, awalnya dia bilang oke begitu saya suruh nyicip dia langsung mengambil semua dan mengganti dengan yang baru. Waktu mau ambil kue saya menemukan piring kotor dan sendok juga kurang bersih. Untuk Aston hati-hati dan cicip semua menu sebelum disajikan. Coba bayangkan itu sudah berapa orang yang makan sayur basi. Anda hotel yang lumayan berkelas tapi makanan anda dan kebersihan di tempat makan sangat amat kurang. Semoga diperbaiki segera!",aston kuta,Bali

The mattress poorly thin that we had back-ache the next morning. The pillow was lumpy. Bed sheets had unpleasant smell, stained and harsh feel. There were stains of menstrual blood on the towels that we immediately asked for change. The cleanliness of the bathroom was so sad that we almost vomit every morning.

When I wanted to take the cake I found a dirty plate and a spoon that wasn't clean either. For Aston, be careful and taste all menus before serving.

Rude! Ok I get it, so much rude people at this hotel. Now when I enter the room, okay the room is quite spacious (deluxe premier) the bed is big and comfortable but right when opening the window the view is just the wall TT After that I immediately showered, the bathroom was quite good and there was a bathtub. For the shower on the side of the bathtub, I turned on the water and took a warm shower. Now when I get ready for a break, I hear a noise maybe because it is located close to the hallway and still on the same floor as the lobby (room no. 120), it&#39;s a bit annoying but it&#39;s okay. The next morning at 6 I had to take a shower immediately because there was an appointment in the morning. And I&#39;m shocked! The water I turned on from the bathtub was very dirty. I didn&#39;t even last night. I waited 10-15 minutes to an hour until I gave up and called room service and complained. The room service just said, wait, wait, 15 minutes until the water is no longer cloudy. Oh God it&#39;s not murky, it&#39;s dirty because it&#39;s brown. Then I say that I&#39;ve waited more than that but it&#39;s still dirty. They said they would handle it immediately, but I didn&#39;t wait until 9 no one came to my room. Finally I showered using water from the sink (taking water using a TT glass) because the water from there wasn&#39;t dirty luckily. Then at night I ordered food because I was hungry, fried banana cheese and fried duck (fried banana cheese is pretty good but fried duck tastes weird and the duck is not like in the picture even wrapped in crispy flour which is so weird) a total of 100K. Overall no matter how good the room is if it&#39;s noisy and the view of the walls and dirty water in the morning, still I&#39;m so disappointed and never go back to this hotel again!

Nurulisyah A.,5.4,10 Nov 2019,"Checked in around 4 pm and went straight to the receptionist, during the check-in process the female receptionist immediately commented &quot;I&#39;m so tired, I see her face, rich, I just arrived in Bali, huh?&quot; Oh well, I think that&#39;s rude for a receptionist to comment about your face: / Then the officer who brought my backpack to my room asked me if I was alone in Bali, I answered yes I was alone because I was traveling solo, then he answered &quot;it&#39;s not very good, sis, you&#39;re alone here&quot;. Rude! Ok I get it, so much rude people at this hotel. Now when I enter the room, okay the room is quite spacious (deluxe premier) the bed is big and comfortable but right when opening the window the view is just the wall TT After that I immediately showered, the bathroom was quite good and there was a bathtub. For the shower on the side of the bathtub, I turned on the water and took a warm shower. Now when I get ready for a break, I hear a noise maybe because it is located close to the hallway and still on the same floor as the lobby (room no. 120), it&#39;s a bit annoying but it&#39;s okay. The next morning at 6 I had to take a shower immediately because there was an appointment in the morning. And I&#39;m shocked! The water I turned on from the bathtub was very dirty.

Handuk kotor ada bercak noda. Seperti darah dan kuning‚Äù. Kamar mandi pembuangan air lama sehingga air banjir kacau kacau. Parkir tidak ada security atau petugas jadi hanya sembarangan saja dimana saja susah juga untuk keluar kalau ada mobil dibelakang kita. Bell boy tidak ada jadi bawa koper sendiri angkat sendiri udah jauh amat dari parkiran. Depan.

Cuma sayang pas check in ga dikasih welcome drink, padahal panas banget menunggu kamar siap tapi turis luar negeri dikasih welcome drink. Minusnya cuma kamar agak sempit, ceiling kamarnya pendek, jadi kerasa sempit banget. Sarapannya rasanya lumayan aja, masih bisa ditingkatkan lagi.

Putri F.,8.6,Profil ini privat.,"We're a group of 10 going in a holiday together. We booked 5 executive seaview rooms. Stays in the best class of this hotel rooms, our impressions are : 1. Our room was spacious, but dirty, dark/poor lighting..even one of bathroom in my friend's room is cannot turn on. My friend already called the reception several times and they promises to send an electrician but it never came until day 3 üòÖüòÖ The floor is so dirty if you didn't wear slippers on the room your foot will turn into black. Yes, I mean it. It is that dirty. 2. The staff is so slow and lack of responses. I already mention in 1st comment that the electrician never came into my friend's room, so is what happen in my room. One of the door that connected my room with the pool cannot open. I asked the bell boy to called someone to fix it since the second I came into the room, but they never show. I already remind them by phone, but same result, they never came. It also took forever for us to ask something. My husband called housekeeping for sajadah, it came after 3 calls and an almost an hour later üòÖ My friend also called for plates, same result, it came after 3 phone calls and 35 minutes later. FYI, our room is in the second floor, right above the lobby and restaurant üòÇüòÇ 3. They put the 'forbidden to swim' sign in the pool in the afternoon (start 5 p.m) and in the morning. What??? Then why the hell we paid for executive pool and sea view room if we cannot swim?? The make excuse it's because the pool is right above the dinner area so they afraid it will bother other guest. Ok, I accept that reason, but they still put the sign until 7 a.m when my kids started cranky asking for swim After I protest and angry to reception (and for sure, 3 phone calls) they took that sign. 4. The breakfast and location is might be the only highlights of this hotel. In this area, this hotel offer a reasonably price. It only 1km and 15 minutes walk to Kuta Beach Walk and so is Legian Street.

My friend already called the reception several times and they promises to send an electrician but it never came until day 3 üòÖüòÖ The floor is so dirty if you didn't wear slippers on the room your foot will turn into black. Yes, I mean it. It is that dirty. 2. The staff is so slow and lack of responses. I already mention in 1st comment that the electrician never came into my friend's room, so is what happen in my room. One of the door that connected my room with the pool cannot open. I asked the bell boy to called someone to fix it since the second I came into the room, but they never show. I already remind them by phone, but same result, they never came. It also took forever for us to ask something. My husband called housekeeping for sajadah, it came after 3 calls and an almost an hour later üòÖ My friend also called for plates, same result, it came after 3 phone calls and 35 minutes later. FYI, our room is in the second floor, right above the lobby and restaurant üòÇüòÇ 3. They put the 'forbidden to swim' sign in the pool in the afternoon (start 5 p.m) and in the morning. What??? Then why the hell we paid for executive pool and sea view room if we cannot swim?? The make excuse it's because the pool is right above the dinner area so they afraid it will bother other guest. Ok, I accept that reason, but they still put the sign until 7 a.m when my kids started cranky asking for swim After I protest and angry to reception (and for sure, 3 phone calls) they took that sign. 4. The breakfast and location is might be the only highlights of this hotel. In this area, this hotel offer a reasonably price. It only 1km and 15 minutes walk to Kuta Beach Walk and so is Legian Street. They change various of breakfast menu everyday although the taste was western standard a.k.a less spicey for indonesian like us.",wyndham garden kuta beach bali,Bali

Amelia H.,6.1,23 Mar 2019,"The hotel has a very good location. But it is a very old facility. They are renovating a few of the wings, but was not really mindful of the time. The work was still going on a little bit passed 9pm which made it difficult for our kids to sleep. However, the staff were friendly.",wyndham garden kuta beach bali,Bali
Hendra L. N.,6.4,23 Mar 2019,"I just don't think the hotel deserve 4 stars. The hotel is currently under renovation. The pool was very small. Room was average, bathroom amenities very basic. They only provide body towel, no hair towel, bath robe etc. Breakfast option were very little, coffee machine broke down and the didn't do anything about it while they have two coffee machine in their cafe. At most, i‚Äôd give the hotel 3 stars, but definitely not 4 stars.",wyndham garden kuta beach bali,Bali

The walls between rooms are very thin, I can hear my neighbor talking, can even hear the exact contents of the conversation. The sound of the door being opened and the knock on the wall from various neighboring neighbors both from the right, left and front greatly disturbed the rest. My room neighbors came home at 2:30 and they laughed along the hallway and made us all wake up. The most disturbing is the sound of rain directly on the window pane.

Yah seharusnya ada stand by lah di counter FO saya kira itu sudah menjadi standar nya. Staff malam pun sangat santai sebagai pekerja pariwisata yg disebut hospitality / keramahan. Karna ketika sekitar pukul 2 sy ke lobby mengambil makanan dari ojek online. Saya lihat ada seseorang pria yg duduk menaikan kaki ke kursi lainnya (selonjoran) itu tidak menghampiri saya dan bertanya dari jauh sangat tidak mencerminkan pariwisata bali yg saya kenal..

Helmy,"8,7",23 Jun 2022,"Kami berlibur bersama 4 keluarga, masing2 membawa anak-anak, jadi dengan adanya kolam renang disini, apalagi berdekatan dengan pantai Kuta, menjadi hiburan yang sangat menarik bagi anak-anak. Tapi memang risiko berada di pusat keramaian, kemacetan selalu terjadi, jadi tidak perlu heran bila akhirnya kami lebih baik berjalan kaki ke pusat2 hiburan. Kecuali tentunya ke tempat wisata, kami naik bis sewa-an. Secara umum Eden Hotel menjadi tempat yg sangat nyaman untuk keluarga berlibur di Bali.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

Not a Balinese decor, it is contemporary. Pool bar plays pretty cheap annoying pop music all day and part of the evening, not an enjoyable ambiance unless you are partying then I guess it will be great.

We stayed for a week, at first we got room with the AC not cool at all, only when there's an electric problem in that room so we moved to another room for the last 2 days and everything was good in the second room. 
Housekeeping were good but just not good enough because my cup still had the coffee stained inside and they didn't change my bed sheet when I asked. I won't ask if we only stay there for 3 days but I stay for a week so ofc I want my bed sheet get changed after 3-4 days.
The breakfast menu was so poor because everyday was the same menu. I'm sick to eat them the same for a week :'( until the last day, we had breakfast before check out and I didn't finish the porridge, only because I can't fly with empty stomach that I eat only fruits and drink a lot of the juice and water :(
As the title said, it all maybe because of the promo price? I was shocked before, I can't believe I can stay a week at the 4‚≠ê hotel with 2‚≠ê price. But, my experience there was even worst than when I stayed at 2‚≠ê hotel. Well,  Lesson learned.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

It has two nicely placed pool combined with the calm ambience of the environment. My view from the second floor balcony did offer a pleasant experience. The room is acceptable and its cleanliness is a bit above the standard of hotel in Kuta. However, I personally feel this hotel is quite average.

No slippers as advertised. No hand soap, had to use the shampoo cum soap dispenser. Outdoor rattan chair broken (the same for most of the rooms). The saving grace was the complimentary room upgrade to Pool Access and early (11am) check in and late (2pm) checkout by Agoda, and the pandemic discount rate. There are two medium sized pools which are sweet with a swim-up bar (but closed) but there is little privacy as all the pool access rooms face it. Some guests appear to be longstayers with their own BBQ pit, gas tank, hifi. Overall, the hotel is adequate though not luxurious.

However, another aspect of its location is the area outside the hotel.  The Beach is within easy walking distance, but is not a nice part of the beach; no bars, no restaurants and it is dirty.  Also outside the choice of restaurants and bars is much more restricted than it is if you go much further into Kuta, or better still Legian.

A bit noisy in the corridor in the early morning as sound insulation is :(. you will be waken up by  guest as they come in and out.  Don't get room next the the other hotel as youngsters stay in the adjacent hotel pool,.talking very load till 4:00 am !,  Our room supposed to have balcony but was blocked by wall built by the Hotel so room a bit dark,  Just black luck during our stay. 
At least 20 min walk from Beach walk shopping mall but 10 min walk to Discovery Mall and 260 m to Lippo Mall.  Overall if you book at discount rate and including breakfast, good choice. 
Staff are polite and courtesy.

Few hours later, another problem faced during our sleep, our room suddenly black out. Although we asked to change room twice (first during the door issue), we were just told to wait for the repairs.

The staff is really friendly and helpful. There is also a big swimming pool and you could get the drinks directly in the pool.
I gave only 3 star to the location because if you want some nightlife you need to reach Legian or at least walk for a while. You could took a taxi, but in some hours like 4/6 pm the traffic jam is crazy; you move quicker walking (I am not exaggerating). Also the beach is at 15  min by foot (the closest part does not have the sand).

The hotel itself was decent for the price we paid (around 300,000 Ruppiah) and while the room we were given was on the top (6th) floor, there was no view. The balcony was walled up above head height. Maybe the view wasn't much to shout about but it's a bit strange to have a balcony that is just surrounded by walls.

Cons-Non smoking room was linked to a heavy smoke draft down corridor. Smokers everywhere and it was very heavy. Pool is tiny compared to picture and is shallow. Pool room was a wading pool not the pool in the picture. Breakfast was heavily laden in carbs and consisted of Asian and Middle Eastern foods including curries. Not ideal for a T1 Diabetic.

Just the hotel facility not great. Water in the adult swimming pool is dirty. I was staying in Family Room with Connecting Door. My air con in living room is not cold at all.

The only setback was the hotel booking condition. it was a non-free cancellation and payment directly to the hotel. two days before the date of check in, the hotel sent a message asking for credit card info to pay for one night stay, in order to SECURE my booking. The reason was the system would release my booking if not paid, according to the hotel. however, it is not logical, as i would be charged the full fee if i did not check in anyway.

 i did not give the sensitive info over email and had to call Agoda staff (who was really helpful), to liase with the hotel.

After many calls and emails, the hotel finally agree for me to pay upon my arrival. that was an unpleasant experience, otherwise it would be a perfect stay.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

carine,"7,2",08 Apr 2017,"Suitable for guest who just want to stay for 1-2 nights or lesser. 

Stayed there 4 nights in the pool access normal room, experience was bad.

Bedsheet has yellow stains all over. Aircon isn't cold. The whole room look very run down & not what it is stated in the photo. 

Take note hotel room floor is made of titles not carpet, first time been to a hotel room with titles not carpet. Titles look old and dirty.

Hotel room even have foul smell from the sewage. Easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed.

However, staff are all very attentive & friendly. (Excellent service from staff)

Great service recovery from manager after we called in agoda to complain. Before that kept asking to change room and staff kept trying to brush us off and say they will provide air fresher instead.

Only after complain to agoda and agoda brought up the matter to management, the manager came to speak and upgrade use to another room which is bigger & with bathtub. As well as complimentary breakfast & airport transfer (which we did not use as airport is only 1.7km away from hotel) took a taxi at only 140,000 IDR.

No foul smell & aircon is much better after the change of room. However, I think the aircon in all rooms are quite weak.. so think twice if u are afraid of heat.

Radi,"7,2",09 Apr 2017,"We were here for just one night. Found the fridge to be not working, AC not cooling properly, and the door key was not working either. It seemed like a rebranded hotel made from an old one, with connected buildings and forced blocked views.  The setting could be much better but they have set up walls everywhere making the hallways claustrophobic. Breakfast was very good. Swimming pool was also good. 
What was most annoying for us was how the reception dealt with our doorkey problem. The electronic card key was not working from the beginning at noon. And the reception checked the same thing twice and gave us the key saying it is okay... it will work when we return from shopping. We were back nearly at 10:50pm and we had to go to the room to find out we could not get in. We called the reception taking help from the guests fro. the room besides us but still they said that we needed to go down to talk to them again. At 11pm we were exhausted but had to go up and down with all our bags because their keys would not work that we informed from noon. At the end they opened the door again with admin key and then later at night someone came to fix it. 
I would not really recommend it much for the service much. But the location and food is perfect. Exactly near the airport and easy to shop from here. So you can still give it a try.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

cleanliness is very satisfying

suitable breakfast
only two problems
firstly the air conditioner should not have such a position
took refuge under stone ornaments until we slept in the heat
for the first night with heat with mosquito ...
The next day we had to move another room
but still less cold air conditioner is just no mosquito
the pool problem
many travelers are drinking in the pool
so we are muslim hard to be with the shower
a little bit disturbed should be confused with Muslims and non Muslims
we are from malaysia that Islam is quite sensible with this issue

I ask about change for my larger currency bills. They informed me the driver had change. We'll arriving at the airport, hotel driver had no change and it was 90k.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

The hotel seems to be corrupt and the staff steals from the rooms hence we had to move hotel as it was not safe for us or our children. We reported the stealing and the hotel manager did not care about such incidents. Very concerning.

From the started the hotel facilities has been a disappointment. Its feels like an overly crowded apartment with 1 small pool in the middle to be shared by no less that 150 rooms.  All i have witness is continues unhappy customer debating at the front desk. We didn't have our room until 4pm and we have to insist we want the room. we had the pool excess room and it wasn't what we image it would be.  rooms wasn't clean,  pool was really small and wasn't  best to accommodate the 4 block of apartment looking rooms.  The whole feel an look of the hotel is bad. Over booked room with small coffee house that could not accommodate us and we are asked to have breakfast at level 6 ( dont go there). Food was cold, not label, not much variety compared to the coffee house and i must say it really dirty.

I was terribly upset with the staffs and showed them the proof of bookings. Instead of apologizing , they called their internal and brushed me off by saying okay they will give me the family suite but I need to wait in a temporary room while waiting for the rooms to be ready.

One of the things that I like best about the hotel is that their symbolic colour is green, which makes the place more relaxing. 
However, the staff are not really friendly and not welcoming. They just do their job without smiles or enthusiasm.

We were allocated at the back of the hotel & room smelled liked cigarettes & wasn't cleaned properly. Depending on your nationality, your allocated room will be in accordance to your race. White Anglo's are generally on lower floors near pool area, Asian westerners are usually on the upper floors furthest to the pool or white Anglo's & the locals tend to be scattered around. We won't be staying there ever again as we prefer to have a hotel that will accept & accommodate to all races & nationalities without feeling excluded or discriminated. We don't think it's the staff that are doing this but more a directive from upper management & for that reason, we're choosing to stay elsewhere next time.

Access to room is terrible, not all room is ""at lift level"", for certain room, you need to drag your luggage for half floor up.

Sterling,"8,8",22 Mar 2017,"Check in staff were rushed and didn't have time to answer general questions about the room. Not very friendly overall- no smiles or welcoming attitude across all staff. When we first checked in, the room they gave us reeked of cigarette smoke. They offered to have someone spray it to cover the smell, but we asked for a different room. They said someone would come to help us with bags back to reception. (They told us the other room wouldn't be ready for 2 hours- ended up being about an hour.) Waited 5-10 minutes and no-one came so carried our bags back to reception ourselves. The room we ended up getting was great- clean and air conditioning worked really well. Location was great too- out of the centre of Kuta but close to a lot of restaurants and shops that were great to explore. Close to Waterbom Park if that's your jam.

Lovely for the family hey! They claim it's in a great location - not, far from Kuta and the beach and on a busy road. They have a comment at the top that reads ""Regular breakfast"" that turns out to be a commnet they thenselves chose - as opposed to most hotels they have no breakfast, its an expensive extra cost.

I think it was from a local cat / cats but not 100&% sure ,  not something that  is inviting to say the least.

Johanna,"5,2",05 Jul 2017,"we stopped by as an airport transfer hotel and thought the price was decent and the 20% discount off spa/food appealing. Upon arriving the check in process was lengthy, the girl at the counter was polite and friendly. The guy with bleached hair not so friendly and treated you like a nuisance. Customer service needs to be more consistent. Rooms were very basic motel style, not 4 star at all, not very clean and not quite ""filthy""; shoe prints all over tiles, and glass doors stained with flecks of toothpaste etc, couch had brown marks all over. We decided to indulge in a spa treatment for a couple paying 650,000rp. Absolutely worst spa we have ever been with the staff talking rudely about us, they had not realised we understood Bahasa Indonesia. Absolutely unprofessional as they pointed to the nether regions and commented and prolonged. They did not accept credit card(CASH only) or the 20% discount package we had paid for, until we told them to call reception and marched us down to the reception to pay. The ""spa"" was actually a run down hotel room on the fifth floor. Wallpaper peeling off the walls. Towels on massage table were absolutely disgusting. Spa was absolutely filthy and low grade, the bathroom was caked with black mold and brown stains running down the toilet pipes. I have photos taken and can verify this statement. The treatment was comical, imagine sticking two adults in a tiny bath with both our feets pushed up to our knees. Why anybody would want to stay here is beyond me. Is it decent spa treatment, no, absolute rubbish, worst spa experience in my life. Was it a cheap room,Yes. Would I stay again, never.

Fawaz,"6,8",13 Jun 2017,A good choice for families with kids. The beach is a 10 min walk away so it becomes a problem for small kids. Take a shortcut thru discovery mall during low tide. The beach ends just behind the mall. There was a small kids pool which my daughter enjoyed but not much organized activities for kids. The main pool is also kinda small and since we were spending most of our hours outside and then were going to check into beach resort in Benoa for last few days were not interested much in using the pool. The rooms were nice. We had a family room which had 2 connecting rooms with a large king bed in one room and a single bed in other. Staff are very courteous and bathrooms well fitted(and importantly.. have handheld water sprays for post lavatory cleanuo.. most imp for us). The breakfast was also decent and halal. But not as extensive as i have seen elsewhere. Checkin took us a bit of a time eventhough they knew we were on our way. We had lunch in that time in thr hotel restaurant,eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

There is a shortage of sunbeds two in-between two rooms but also available of any of the 277 rooms. If you want to sunbathe by the pool this isn't the hotel for you, the pools are situated in the middle of the building so gets little direct sunshine. The food was good but I felt directed more towards Asian taste than western. The swim up bar was nice and the staff great thanks to Pandra and Debbi, there is entertain on some evenings but not a lot of people attended, a real shame Sandy the singer was really good.

The service is super good, breakfast was awesome, they keep refilling the food from 6am- 10am.  The breakfast was a lot of choices too, i think its great! Keep it up!! 

The family room( 1 double bedroom w bathroom, 1 twin bedroom w showeroom and sitting area w toilet room) it was great  for a family adult of 4! Spacious enough. Our view was the main pool at the highest floor. I cant thank you enough for the superb service beforehands. 

The only issue I had was the aircond at first but it was fixed immediately. Then in the bathroom it was very dim, I think another light would be good. Otherwise everything is great! 

The location is a plus too! Literally 3-5 mins to Lippo mall and 10 mins to Discovery mall/ waterbom. In between there are small mart and streets souvinier shops.

When we got to our room it was in very poor condition. The sheets were very heavily stained and so were the towels. I examined the mattress and there was an ant in the sheets. The bathroom was a nightmare. Mould in the corner near the toilet and in the shower. The shower was a horrible design, made to hide its age and use which didn't actually hide anything anyway. I would post photos if I could. We requested that the sheets be replaced and watched the guy do it, he went through nearly 6 sets before he found some clean ones. Had dinner at the restaurant and it was horrid. Obviously frozen-ready meals just warmed up.

The hotel is less than5 minutes drive from The Airport. Bcs I've never been to Bali before, i have no idea how far is the Hotel from the Airport, so i decided to take the Airport Taxi and must pay IDR 100.000 (about AUD 10) for a short drive to the hotel, for me it is very expensive (comparing to a very short distance) My recommendation is, try to arrange a rental car delivered to you at the airport as you arrive (much cheaper, mine was delivered to Eden Hotel, i rent an Automatic Transmission Suzuki Splash for IDR 275.000 / day).",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

MD,"6,4",06 Jul 2017,"1.Location is good only for shopping. Not really close to the beach, quite a bit of crowd, narrow, unclean space compared to parts like nusa dua or seminyak.
2.While I like the nature theme they have going, energy conservation is an issue. The halls, lobby are very poorly lit, most lights are turned off after 11. The hotel itself is barely noticeable from the roadside compared to others. In this case It's literally 'outshined' by surrounding hotels.

3. Pool is crowded and shallow. The pool bar was always occupied. 
4. Breakfast is very sub standard. Nothing special or mention worthy. Also, very crowded.
5. Hotel design/architecture is another let down. I'm guessing it was built in stages and the rooms are located haphazardly and design language is confusing. Lobby, mezzanine, breakfast room all seem scattered. Doesn't live up to the pictures even. 
6. The age is showing very much. Bathrooms are old, tiles are rusty with holes on the floor. Don't like the color scheme of the rooms either. Lighting is again an issue with only spot lights in the room itself.

We had a free upgrade at ground floor near the pool view but we need to change room for the other 5 nights due to fully booked.  So, we shifted to level 2 but one of the room's Aircon was not working. The staffs are very nice and came to take a look and change the gas. However, the Aircon was still not working. The friendly staffs help to change us (2rooms) to level 6.  Sad to say that level 6 wifi signal was so weak. My sons were upset and requested to look into the wifi signals. After confirming poor wifi signal, the staffs once again help us to change room. But I had been changing rooms everyday, so I requested a upgrade to pool view with good Aircon and good wifi signals.

Jonic,"9,2",27 Dec 2022,"The Staff are always AMAZING. They work so hard. Front desk, pool bar, restaurant, house keeping etc.  However improvements can also be made in regards to replacing broken items. The blender in the pool bar was replaced finally after more than a week. This may seem petty but the staff behind the bar are the ones dealing with the complaints when it is beyond their control to replace these items. The CD player was/is broken, the TV had to be repaired. I would like them to put a large  fan under the pool bar roof as it is very hot when sitting at the pool bar. The fan would cool that area which would encourage more guests to stay around the pool bar and spend more money.  Shout out to Wie, Pande, Reza, A'ang, Edi, Natha.

-Buffet varies daily with modest selection

-Beds are reasonably comfortable 
-Good air conditioning units

Cons:
-Expect delayed check-in. Check-in is stated as 2:00pm, however rooms usually are not available until 3:00pm to 4:00pm. This may be due to room cleaning services being understaffed.
-Sewage piping has slow drainage. Sinks and bathtubs will accumulate water because of slow drainage. 
-Reuse of towels and bedding without proper sanitation. Markings were found on towels and bedding that resembled human waste.
-Driving services can become a tourist trap. Be sure to emphasize a direct route if necessary or their drivers will take you to unnecessary tourist sites that are time- consuming and costly.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

Hadi,"9,6",21 May 2017,"This is second time for my family to stay here. Because we had enjoyable hotel, this holiday I invite my friend and his family to enjoy this hotel facilities.

Positive points are: value for money for 4 stars hotel, all staffs friendly, clean and pleasant room, good swimming pool. Near with airport, malls, water boom, and cafes. Breakfast have variation and tasty. Nice welcome drinks.

My daughter get free mini cake for her birthday from staff hotel. Little but delicious. This is a surprised.

My friend complain about his room. The whole floor is always wet and cold (maybe a guest below his room turn on his AC to coldest). With friendly, staff hotel change his room to another, thank you.

Negative points are:  location hotel is far enough to Kuta Beach, Airport transfer fee is expensive for short distance. Perhaps could be consider to decrease or free the fee... :)

The staff are friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast is extensive in asian and western food options. The beds are very (too) firm, but the pillows are nice. The rooms are NOT soundproofed, so you will hear people in the pool, the halls, and the rooms next to you. We booked two rooms, and the description said that they were interconnecting, but they weren't -- they were side by side only, with no door between the two.

No issue. However, there are two things on the downside that I would like to comment. These are with regards to the facilities in the hotel. One , my shower room scupper was partially choked, such that each time we took shower the floor got flooded. Two, the elevator request button at my floor level had a technical problem. I have to press hard and/or jabbed it many times before the light was 'on' stating my request was 'approved' and the elevator arrived.

The Hotel has a good Buffet breakfast and 24 hrs Room Service (if we may request the management to review the items on the menu and change the room service menu it's cld do wonders) they have buy 1 get one free menu on food and drink in the afternoon and evening so it's a bargain if your staying in. Negative: the door is thin so you can hear people talking when they pass by and even the walky talky that staff walk around with, if you take a room facing the children pool be ready to hear kids screaming and playing, the same goes for adult pool facing rooms.

The hotel room itself was very clean, very nicely equipped and the bathroom facilities were on point. The other downside was we had to go past a good 30 rooms or so to finally reach our room from the lifts!

We were staying in EDEN for 5 days 4 nights.
Breakfast were served with many varieties of delicious food..:)
Room conditions were clean BUT air condition need further upgrade due to very hot temperature in Bali.
We will definitely come again and recommend to other friends
Well done EDEN HOTEL Kuta Bali...:)",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali
Jakyee,"6,3",09 Jul 2017,"Location is superb, walking distance to convenience shops & eateries.
However, we were put into a room facing the main road, was very noisy at night with motocycles passing by.
Sound proofing not good at all. Can't get a restful sleep.
Room aircon was not strong, feeling so warm in the room. It needs an hour or more to cool the entire room.
Had a electricity blackout in the early morning, had to deal with no lights in the room and showered with cold water. Ok for us as we were feeling so warm with the room, maynot be acceptable to people who needs a warm shower.",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

Michael,"7,7",06 Jul 2017,"We were booked into the Eden because it was close to the airport and done by friends for us. We asked to be moved from our original room because the music at the pool bar was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves or the TV. This was done very quickly. Our second room was ok, same as the first, in the front building of the hotel. When you opened the door you could still hear the music, but closed it was fine. The hotel has very little character and the room decor is kitch. The pools are shielded by the hotels, so the sun doesn't get to the pool until the afternoon. It really depends on what you look for in a hotel. My wife and I steer clear of Kuta other than fly in and fly out. The staff were very helpful except for when we checked out and asked if we could get a taxi to take us to our preferred location of Seminyak. They tried to get us to pay 200 thousand rupiah when a taxi from outside will cost 40 thousand. Why tourists are not treated with some respect leaves a sour taste in my mouth after a beautiful holiday. I would not recommend the Eden, but as I said, it depends on what you want in a hotel?",eden kuta hotel bali,Bali

Jonic,"8,7",22 Apr 2017,"The first 2 nights were very noisy by guests (non Australian) awake at 3:30am for their religious reasons but we're very inconsiderate towards sleeping guests as they yelled across from balcony to balcony to each other. If you want to speak to someone at three in the morning go to their room!!!!!! I was designated as the spokes person and emailed the hotel managers who were quick, professional and genuinely concerned about our situation. They added extra security to walk the pool area and from then on all quiet. There was a family staying there who played with a football in the pool which was a bit annoying as people wanted to relax in the pool quietly without getting splashed and hit by the football. I personally didn't think they needed to take up the entire pool area every day for hours. Smoking in the pool by some of the guests was a real turn off for me. Breathing in someone else's 2nd hand smoke is bad enough but trying to swim while people are smoking IN the water was plain rude. I have to include this information for it to be a REAL review. However, If you don't mind smokers, then you will absolutely LOVE this hotel. It's clean, fresh and modern with AMAZING staff at reception, management are quick and professional and cannot do enough for you if treated with the same kindness and respect they give to their guests. A shout out to Reza and Pande in the pool bar. Reza is always ready with a smile and a chat. He makes a mean lemon cooler (tanpa gula) for those who want a thirst quencher non-alco recovery drink. I can't rave enough about all the beautiful friendly staff. Location is excellent close walking distance to everything. Ive stayed here many many times and it's my go to hotel. I highly recommend it for couples who want a peaceful rest by the pool. The breakfast caters for everyone and complete with an egg station is yummy and delicious.

Vicktor,"8,8",26 Jan 2019,"Room was clean, staffs are friendly and helpful. I rented 2 room for 2 nights, 1 of the room had an issue with the AC. The front desk staffs quickly called engineering to check the AC, but after 1 hour the engineering staff didn't show up... And my kom had to call the frontdesk once more until the engineering staff come to check... And after around 45 minutes of checking the engineering and administration staffs finally decided to move my mom into a different room which has normal AC. They did a good job! Just a suggestion however, probably in the future please don't let guest wait for too long for checking. Just move the guest directly to a new room and you can check or fix the AC as long as you like. Because it was already 10:30PM and my mom was already tired for the day, and she still had to wait for the engineering staff to check the AC in the room... Overall stay was 7.5/10, if the AC was good 9/10. Thanks",infinity8 bali,Bali

David,"2,4",02 Jul 2017,"Terrible location.  Breakfast if served in a hot sweatbox on the roof.  They have chefs up there preparing eggs, but it is so extremely hot in the breakfast area that the chefs are sweating profusely.  Perspiration is literally dripping off them into the food they are preparing.  

The rooms are small, dark and unexceptional.  

Depaite requests, counter staff WILL NOT CALL YOU A TAXI.  Instead you get harassed by their in house car service representative to use their car.

There are many, many better alternative places to stay when visiting Bali.  I would urge you to do so.  For the sake of hygiene if nothing else.",infinity8 bali,Bali

The hotel is very nice place and good / great value at that price.
The breakfast was buffet style, with an egg station and lots more, very good.
Staff were excellent!!
The only downside is its location, it's a bit remote, close to lots of things but you'll need transport!
If this place was on the beach, I'd imagine it would be costing $100's per night",infinity8 bali,Bali

Scott,"6,8",29 Apr 2017,"It's located in a fairly good location for some really nice restaurants and local food. The downside was their breakfast selection.

Ng·ªçc,"2,8",03 Mar 2017,"This was the part of my trip I was looking forward to the most. Beautiful photos of the hotel - all photoshopped. Inifinty pool over looks a rough school. Staff on the front desk are rude, unhelpful, and seem to want you out of the way so they can carry on doing nothing.  Difficult to ask advice or for assistance in getting around Jimbaran. This hotel caters for and only cares for Chinese group booking tourists, so breakfast is primarily Chinese food. Non-smoking room? Be sure that Chinese tourists will completely ignore all rules, and your room will smell constantly of smoke, but the hotel will send someone to spray a strong air freshener in your room rather than deal with the problem. You will be kept awake all night by large groups of drunk Chinese tourists shouting in the corridoors, or slamming doors until the ealry hours of the morning will keep your children up, all whilst smoking everywhere they go. Hotel staff will show a complete lack of care, or attention to any complaint.",infinity8 bali,Bali

There was not hooks for towels or clothes in the bathroom and actually i can't say that there was a real bathroom. All doors to bthe toilet and shower were glass.

Pro's: 
1. Good Indonesian breakfast with tasty choices
2. Friendly and accommodating staff
3. It has a nice basic Gym, Rooftop Pool and a Spa were I really got a great massage (one of the best I have had the last 10 years)
4. The food in the restaurant are fairly priced. The cocktails are a little expensive compared to the prices of the food.
5. Easy to get a taxi and close to Nusa Dua beach

Cons:
1.  The cleaners should improve on cleaning the hallways, sinks and bathroom.",infinity8 bali,Bali

They serve great food and then we got to have the happy hours promo from 5-7pm on cocktails. Also, the staff were all accomodating, all smiles and ready to help. Keep it up!",infinity8 bali,Bali
Angelazharyl,"8,4",07 Feb 2017,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and stayed in a very nice hotel Ubud which is a bit far from the Airport, that‚Äôs why we booked this hotel just for a night so we are near the Airport since our flight back to Manila is at 6am. 

For us - it‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre planning a short stay here and save money. WiFi is weak and intermittent though and we haven‚Äôt been able to experience the Infinity pool because it‚Äôs open I think until 7pm only. So yeah, great value for money and near the airport but there are far more better hotels in Ubud if you really plan to make your Bali Vacation extra special.",infinity8 bali,Bali

Alie,"5,6",08 Jan 2017,"For our last day in Bali we wanted to stay at a place with an infinity pool. This place seemed  fancy enough and we decided to go for it. The room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable. That being said, everything else was rather disappointing. The water in the infinity pool was so cold that we could not swim there. The shower was lukewarm, so after the cool swimming pool no heating up. 
The room seemed as though it had been used a lot and had some wear-and-tear. 
The personnel was friendly enough, but not very competent. We ordered a gin-tonic (off-menu) which we thought should not be very hard. In reality it was an impossible task and we got something that tasted like gin with maybe sparkling water? Anyways it was gross. After this being said to the personnel they tried again and failed again. Third time would be a charm, except it wasn't. Even after very thorough explanation, they did not seem to be able to make a gin tonic. 

Personnel was very friendly.",infinity8 bali,Bali
Steven,"9,2",07 Jan 2017,"Hi all

Jason,"10,0",06 Dec 2016,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in.  Staff were polite, attentive and talkative. Nothing was an issue. 

The rooms were clean and well looked after. All the usual places that are normally neglected in other hotels I've stayed in were cleaned thoroughly. This included curtains and hard to reach 'dust collection' points.  I loved how each door had a display panel controlled from inside. This indicated the Do Not Disturb and Housekeeping signs. No more paper slip over the door knob.

Breakfast was always fresh and kept hot (or cold) with a huge selection. The guys on the egg station were super fast and very friendly. Again all the staff were talkative & respectful. You were always greeted with a HUGE smile.

The in-house cafe was great and the menu pretty extensive. Prices were quite reasonable too & food was really good quality.

I loved the huge foyer complete with computer stations for guests to use. The open planned style of the hotel made it feel vast and modern.",infinity8 bali,Bali

The infinity pool is a good place to chill and enjoy the view while relaxing in the water. We had 2 massages as the spa is amazing with a friendly and skilled massage therapist (we can recommend the hot stone massage, 75 min for a reasonable price of approx. 20$). Breakfast was good but nothing special. 

Only thing that disappointed us was dinner as it took over 1h and was overpriced for the quality served. But this is just a minor concern as you can go out to eat in one of the many surrounding restaurants if you have a scooter or order a grab/taxi. 

We would definitely stay here again, especially 1-2 days before or after a flight as the hotel is located close to the airport.",infinity8 bali,Bali

Sarah,"6,8",19 Dec 2016,"The walls are made out of carton I think because I could hear everything people said in the hall way and in the room next door.  Even everything that happend at the reception hall resonated up to the 5th floor. I had better sleep in cheap hostels than this 4* hotel. Also, the location at the busy road isn't so great. Although it was very close to the airport, it took me 45min to get there because of trafic. The rooftop restaurant looked nice so I decided to eat there. Had to wait half an hour before they came to take my order while there were only two tables taken. The other table arrived after me and got their icecream before I could even order my dinner. The food itself looked good, but I had better chicken satays at streetfoodrestaurants than here. It was more fat and bones than chicken. Besides all that, the pool was amazing (though a bit cold, the sea is warmer) and the room was clean. Still I'm glad I booked at a serious discount, because it wasn't worth the money",infinity8 bali,Bali

Certainly shouldn‚Äôt be classed as a beach club. Also we booked the suite as a treat but out of the 3 rooms there was only one small window which looked onto an internal wall meaning there was no natural sun light making the whole room very dark.

When we ordered from menu, the staff member kept coming back to say they did not have that dish. I was extremely shocked to see my body covered with big rashes the next morning. The bed bugs bit me all over my body. I was so itch and in pain from scratching. I should have taken photos and uploaded for all guests to see. Unfortunately, when coming back home the doctor put me on medication but I still have marks all over. When I complained to reception staff, the girls did not seem to care. I then asked for the manager who said I will look into whether others have complained. Not once did the general manager apologize or show much concern. He just walked away. I would not recommend people to stay here. Only good thing was the pool which closed too early every night anyway. This place is not worth your money or time.",infinity8 bali,Bali

MARIAM,"8,0",44920,Hotel and staff are very good (western style). The facilities are very recent with a swimming pool at the rooftop. The location is a bit outside of Jimbaran. It‚Äôs located in the main Road to the south of Bali. You need a car or a scooter to go to the beach.,infinity8 bali,Bali
Amber,"8,4",44914,"We got a 50% off deal so it was good value for money but if we were to have paid full price I would of been disappointed. The taxi service they provide is far too overpriced. They said they have scooters available but all 3 times we attempted to hire one they were all booked out. That is understandable but they would not help us to find a scooter from another company as they wanted more money from us to pay for their drivers. The breakfast buffet which was not included so we paid extra for one morning was not very good and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. But staff were friendly, the rooms were very clean and the roof top pool was nice.",infinity8 bali,Bali

Mary,"8,0",44880,"Loved the facilities. The staff was professional concerning everything. 
They should re-think their options when it comes to breakfast. You are catering to different people from around the world. The breakfast should not be strictly Indonesian. This was a downside for me. The location isn't the best. There is nothing around. You will have to rent a motorbike.",infinity8 bali,Bali

Inge,"9,2",44802,"This hotel is incredible for the price you pay. The gym, pool, breakfast and rooms are very nice. The staff is friendly.
The disadvantage is that it is used by Chinese tour groups, so it can be very busy at breakfast in the morning. The other issue is that the hotel doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to control who is smoking in their rooms (not allowed I believe). One of our neighbors smoked inside, and our room smelled very bad.
The location is not great, but there are some restaurants down the street and they rent out motorbikes so you can get everywhere.",infinity8 bali,Bali

The access to  parking lot was quite narrow,  especially if you're a new driver..

Frederic,"8,8",44755,"I stayed in this hotel for 8 days and my overall experience was very good. The rooms are very nice and well equipped.

The Wi-Fi worked, but was slow...good for checking mails and social media, bad for anything traffic intensive.

Only thing you should know is the location, you can rent scooters there for a little more than usual price to get to the beach. Walking is over 1 hour through dense traffic. If you want to be close to the airport it is perfect, if you are looking for Bali Beach experience it is not optimal.",infinity8 bali,Bali

We enjoyed the breakfasts on rooftop and the swimming-pool.
The room was nice, bed was comfortable and clean.
We rented a motorcycle and when we took it we noticed the bottom part of it was damaged and that the motorbike was dirty... Providing motorcycle not damaged and clean would made the stay perfect.
We wanted to try balinese massage our last evening in Bali but there was only 1 member of staff available to practice and suggested that one of us try it... we asked if it would be possible to be massaged the next day before our flight but massage was not available at morning.. Maybe next time ^^
Except what I said below with motorcycle and massage, we have nothing wrong to say about this hotel. We will probably go back to this hotel if we go back to Bali someday. Thank you,

There was a lot of staff that could attend to our every need. The quality of the food in the restaurant was remarkable. 
One thing to keep in mind is it's on a freeway and quite hard to access without a car, and when the hotel calls a taxi for you it can take up to 20mn to arrive (if they even get through to the taxi company!).

Steve,"9,2",44662,"L'h√¥tel correspond parfaitement √† mes attentes et surtout √† sa pr√©sentation g√©n√©rale.
Les chambres sont parfaitement propres et spacieuses, la qualit√© de la literie √©galement !
La piscine sur le toit est splendide, le coucher de soleil y est tout aussi sympathique.

Tim,"4,8",44586,"Als positiv ist der Service und die Bem√ºhung des Personals zu bewerten.  
- Begr√ºssungsgetr√§nk wird anscheinend nur sporadisch ausgegeben
- wir kamen eine Stunde nach Check-In- Zeit, m√ºssten trotzdem auf unser Zimmer warten und unser Gep√§ck dann selbst hochbuckeln
- Shuttleservice zu den ausgew√§hlten Str√§nden konnte zwar problemlos angemeldet werden, allerdings musste man immer mindestens eine halbe Stunde auf die Abholung warten, da die vereinbarten Abholzeiten eigentlich die Abfahrtszeiten vom Hotel waren, was leider nicht kommuniziert wurde
- der Sauberkeitsanspruch entsprach nicht dem eines 4-Sterne-Hotels
- viele Stellen an der kompletten Hotelanlage waren schon sehr abgelebt (zum Beispiel waren die Toilettenpapierhalterung und die Duschamatur defekt) 
- wenn ein erholsamer Urlaub gew√ºnscht ist, sollte man dieses Hotel nicht besuchen, da es jede Nacht haupts√§chlich wegen der asiatischen G√§ste sehr laut war 

Alles in allem kein Hotel f√ºr europ√§ische G√§ste.",infinity8 bali,Bali
Edmond,"9,2",44584,"Sehr nette Angestellte die immer freundlich und L√∂sungsorintiert waren.

Leider hat bei uns das WLAN nicht sonderlich gut funktioniert, so dass wir ein neues Zimmer bekommen haben wo es aber leider auch nicht ging. (Zwar bisschen nervig aber offline sein schadet ja nicht)

Zweiter Punkt der wirklich st√∂rend war sind die nicht vorhandenen Schattenpl√§tze am Pool. Es gab nur einen einzigen Platz am Pool der beschattet ist aber dieser war verst√§ndlicherweise schnell weg. Somit waren die restlichen Pl√§tze nur noch mit Sonnenbrandgarantie √ºber l√§ngerem Zeitraum zu nutzen. Dementsprechend war der Pool sehr selten voll ausgelastet.",infinity8 bali,Bali
Jan,"4,0",44571,"Kurz zusammen gefasst:
- Ratten auf dem Infinity Pool (im Restaurant, auf der Terrasse)
- Shuttleservice zum Strand zwar angeboten, jedoch wurden wir dort dann einfach vergessen.
- Personal war teilweise sehr unbeholfen und musste sich f√ºr alles r√ºckversichern
- Fr√ºhst√ºck war zum mindest in den Sto√üzeiten eine Katastrophe (leere Beh√§lter, Kaffee bis zu 30 Minuten nicht aufgef√ºllt, Teller und Besteck nicht sauber)
- Pool total √ºberchlort 

In Summe einfach unheimlich schlechter Service f√ºr viel zu viel Geld.",infinity8 bali,Bali
Matthias,"8,0",44570,"Im Gesamtpaket waren wir sehr zufrieden.
Sehr freundliches Personal. 

Einige Verbesserungsvorschl√§ge oder Erg√§nzungen:
Zentral an einer gro√üen Stra√üe und daher etwas laut. 
Daf√ºr kostenloser Shuttleservice zu einigen Spots.
Tolle Fr√ºhst√ºcksauswahl, daf√ºr ist der Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum ziemlich hei√ü, da dieser auf dem Dach liegt.

Florian,"6,8",44549,"Das Hotel WIRD sicher gut wenn alles fertig ist. Wir hatten 4 N√§chte gebucht, haben aber die letzten 3 storniert, weil ich Dachterrasse, wo der Pool ist, nicht fertig war. Dort wurde den ganzen Tag geh√§mmert und gebohrt, wie in Rest des hotels. Erholungsfaktor nicht vorhanden. Das wird  sicher anders wenn es denn mal fertig ist.

Auf unsere Bitte hin die letzten 3 N√§chte zu stornieren, mussten wir uns mit agoda in Verbindung setzen, weil dar√ºber gebucht wurde.

Das Hotel erkl√§rte sein Einverst√§ndnis und die Stornierung wurde nett und professionell abgewickelt, weswegen immernoch ein positives Fazit bleibt. Die Lage ist an der Hauptstra√üe eher ungem√ºtlich, eignen sich f√ºr Kurzaufenthalte wenn man beispielsweise bald an den Flughafen muss.",infinity8 bali,Bali

Tapi pas check in akhirnya dapet juga 4 kamar berjejer. Staff hotel ramah, kolam renang bagussss, playground lumayan ok,  judulnya hotel ini kids friendly. Ke airport cuman 10 menit.

Simon,"4,3",15 Mar 2022,"Lokasi dekat Kuta Square, berada di tengah2 antara Beach Walk dan Discovery sehingga mudah kemana2 dengan jalan kaki (< 1 km). Lokasi hotel tidak di tepi pantai. 
Staf resepsionis tidak cekatan, menunggu lama untuk check in padahal yg antri check in tidak banyak, tidak ada keramahan, menyambut tamu dengan ekspresi dan nada bicara datar. 
Staf pembawa koper sama aja, tidak cekatan. Sudah sampai di kamar lama, koper2 tidak terkirim, akhirnya saya ambil sendiri ke bawah dan ternyata masih dibiarkan begitu saja. Untuk penilaian staf, tidak layak sekelas bintang 5, staf hanya sekelas hotel melati yg tidak cara terhadap customer
Untuk makan pagi, cukup banyak macam nya, cukup cepat diisi kembali jika habis, staf2nya juga ramah. 
Untuk kamar, kebersihan bagus, sayang tembok balkon jelek sekali, tidak dicat kembali sehingga membuat malas ke balkon, karena terkesan kotor. 
WC juga mampet

Shower was mouldy, fridge was mouldy, walls and ceiling were mouldy and dirty. The hotel has become very run down and neglected.

I asked reception for a room change but he said that was the last room available as mine that i booked for was a upgraded room type deluxe room. Apparently that was the last room left. So i had to ask housekeeping to change the bedsheet for me and get extra towels to ""manage"" the night. However least did i expect there to be more BLOOD stain on the blanket quilt as well!! I have taken photos  of it and informed receptionist about it in the morning. However, all he said was there was nothing he could do about it and I have to go through Agoda as I booked it here for them to follow up. I am extremely disgusted with the room and need a follow up from the appropriate one. Thank you.",legian paradiso hotel,Bali

I had to insist they change the sheets, I'm glad I did, seriously you would have been shocked. In the morning I found that the toilet didn't work and the bathroom had no towels.

I have never been so appalled by accomodation and service. 
I arrived to Legian Paradiso Hotel, with check in going very smoothly and after that, that‚Äôs when things went down hill. 
When arriving to my room I tried to set up the safe, for it not to work. So went down to reception to notify them, to which I was told someone was going to come take a look at it (which they did). But after 10 minutes of the staff member trying to fix it he realised it was broken too, to which I was told he was going to get me a new one. 
2 hours had gone by sitting in my room not wanting to leave my things unattended and he never came back. But within this time I thought I would turn the tv on to keep me entertained, but the remote was broken so I couldn‚Äôt turn it on. So went back down to reception to ask where my new safe was and to report the broken tv remote to be told they didn‚Äôt know where the man was that was getting me the new safe and hadn‚Äôt heard from him in hours. So had a completely different staff member come up and fixed both problems straight away. That‚Äôs when I thought I could start enjoying my stay, but I was wrong. 
After having a good look around the room I have never seen so much mould in walls before, only one PowerPoint in the room (not near the bed), the toilet smelt and would make my whole room smell unpleasant and the aircon was not even cold! 
Not to mention music was blaring down at the pool (when you have a pool side room makes it unpleasant) until just after 10pm with a bunch of guests screaming and carrying on until after 1am. 
I woke up the next morning and had found bugs in my bed and after requesting for my room to be made up, dirty and smelly sheets were then placed on my bed. 
Later that afternoon when I went to have a shower and turned it on, the bathroom floor started to flood quite quickly. So after turning it off, I",legian paradiso hotel,Bali
Andrea,"6,4",14 Feb 2023,"l was disappointed in the room as it did not look like the photos l could not use the shower because when it was on hooked on the wall the water would shoot past it the wall and run onto the floor it was also in the bath which made it very hard to get into and out of when you are older. On the last day l did slip in the bath trying to get into the bath for a shower.
The AC did leak water and on the 2nd night l slipped when l was coming into the room and strained my back the hotel staff where kind enough to let me stay a few hours after check out to rest my back and the go have a massage before heading to airport for the flight home.
Again l travel to Bali on a very regular basis and still find it disappointing that over covid they did not take the time to really clean the bathrooms (this is the case in every hotel l have stayed in since travelling again after covid) To be honest l did not think the bath had been cleaned in sometime and even if l wanted l bath l could not as no plug .

Cons - Bathrooms not clean to a high standard, towels falling apart, aircon hardly working, swimming pool warm, first room I was in didn‚Äôt have much in terms of locking the door, was a push handle lock and no other security chain etc, not completely safe for a female traveller. Pros - location great, restaurant at the front has great food for decent prices. 

Had issue with my first aircon not working at all, moved rooms and my aircon was leaking. Did not get to a cool enough temp no matter the setting it was on.

My only real con that concerned me was the loose brick tiles around the edge of the pool. My one year olds leg actually went through one day and a staff member saw. I think they were unsure what to do so just laughed it off. 
Aside from that. We will be back and hopefully the pool issue will be rectified.

ALWAYS check the cot mattresses. The ones we were given were torn open, dirty and they simply put more doonas over the mattress to hide the condition. They told us they would dispose of the bug ridden mattress but they ‚Äúsprayed it‚Äù and returned it to our room and told us it was a different one.

Jadi bagi mereka terutama anak2 kecil yang sudah tidak sabar ingin segera masuk kolam renang, kaki mereka yang menempel banyak asir otomatis akan dibersihkan diarea pinggir kolam yang berpadir ini.

Makanan yang disediakan juga cukup bervariasi dan enak dengan pelayanan yang cukup memuaskan. Bentuk bangunan dengan lokasi kamar yang ditempatkan di sisi kanan dan kiri dengan lobby di depan membuat jarak dari kamar ke lobby dan restoran serta ke pantai menjadi tidak jauh sehingga sangat nyaman. Ukuran kamar tidak besar namun bersih. Hal yang dirasakan kurang enak dari hotel ini jika ingin berjalan kaki ke lumayan jauh dan pelayanan pemesanan taksi di depan sangat lama karena pihak hotel mendahulukan tamu yang pesan mobil dengan sistem carter jam-jaman atau harian sehingga kurang memperhatikan tamu yang minta dicarikan taksi dengan argo,nusa dua beach hotel and spa,Bali

Anh,"10,0",05 Mar 2022,"Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is a truly fantastic resort, offering guests the perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and stunning natural beauty. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the breathtaking views of the crystal-clear waters of the Indian Ocean and the lush tropical gardens surrounding the property.

The rooms at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa are spacious, elegantly decorated, and equipped with all the modern amenities one could need. The beds are incredibly comfortable, and the views from the balconies are simply breathtaking. The resort also features several excellent dining options, serving delicious local and international cuisine.

What sets Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa apart, however, is the level of service provided by the staff. They are always willing to go above and beyond to make sure that guests have a truly memorable experience. From arranging activities and excursions to helping with recommendations for local restaurants and shops, the staff truly makes guests feel like royalty.

The resort's spa is a true highlight, offering a range of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments using natural ingredients. The facilities are top-notch, and the therapists are highly skilled, making for an incredibly pampering experience.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing beach holiday in Bali. The combination of stunning natural beauty, comfortable accommodations, excellent service, and first-class spa facilities make this resort a truly exceptional place to stay. I cannot wait to visit again in the future!",nusa dua beach hotel and spa,Bali

I fully recommend this hotel for its value for money, location, private beach, very comfy beds, evening event of dinner with fire dance or Barong dance, and many more! It could be exceptional if they improve daily variation for the breakfast. The daily breakfast menu is okay, the coffee is good, wide variety of menu, it‚Äôs just that the menu stayed the same during our stays, and there is no fresh meat option (beef, poultry, etc), the breakfast meat are all processed meat (smoked chicken, salami, etc).

The resort is older but it has a palace feel to it. Only downside (in my opinion) is that the drinks on the resort are VERY expensive compared to elsewhere. Example: Large Bintangs are about 105 idr but you can buy these for about 40 idr down the street at the convenient store. Food was very good and so are the hotel amenities.

Only good point is that it's near the beach if you like this kind of stuff. It's basically well decorated and u can probably just hide there for the whole vacation.

Although is an old resort, the area was properly maintained, the beachfront was cleaned and I feel they have the best beach section compared to the Westin + Sofitel next door.  I spent my days by the beach lounging on their beach loungers.. 

The hotel spa, however, was not to my expectation.. With the price I paid at a 5 star hotel like this, I would expect a relaxing and soothing environment in the spa room, but the natural lights, was a bit too much, it was too bright.  There's also noise from the session next door (the room wasnt soundproof), the furniture was old and outdated.   However, the exterior was nice, they have 25m lap pool at the spa + other facilities that you can use.

Bendixen,"10,0",23 Sep 2022,"The resort is located inside the highly secured BTDC. You will pass through two security check point. We chose the property because it is one of the few beach front properties in Nusa Dua. If you like to have peace and quiet then this is a perfect choice. There are not as much people on the beach. You will not run out of beach beds placed under the trees lined up at the beach. Its just that Nusa Dua is far from almost every place you will be visiting while in Bali. Our room was beautiful, clean and well maintained. It was a short walk away from the pool. The breakfast is good too, only that the food selection were fewer than other resorts I have visited. There are a number of restaurants at the hotel. If you can't pick from any of them, you can walk by the beach to other properties and check-out their restaurants. There is also a mall nearby called Bali Collection. They have free shuttle going to and from the hotel. The hotel offers a lot of activities to make your stay fun.",nusa dua beach hotel and spa,Bali

Room is BIG and Clean although the furniture and fixture are worn-out coz near the Salty Beach. Well-lighted both room bathroom and balcony. Love the Balcony facing the pool area surprisingly quiet mornings Birds chirping so serene
TV channels/selection is great LOTs of English-speaking programs to watch not just news
Water in Bathroom is strong but depending on the time of the day there is salty taste sometimes
Bed is large comfortable and the linens and pillows have NO bad smell BUT the Bathrobe has bad smell and is obviously UNwashed
The Beach itself is clean soft white sand and water Perfect for swimming

We knew it was quiet for them at time of check in and did happen to ask for a pool view room . The place was quite empty and a shame we could not have a pool view. At time of booking , we were not able to even book one on line.  Our room was in a back garden area with no view. The whole place lacked atmosphere and we were quite surprised that even some of the staff were not too friendly. It really lacked atmosphere!
This was our second visit to this hotel the first time being about 18 years ago and probably the last. Lots of resorts on that same strip I would recommend to stay at.

When you check in they take 5000000 idp from you as a security deposit which they say will be blocked until you check out but it has actually been taken out of my husbands account and he is trying to get a written confirmation from them to say it will be returned but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone in this hotel can type up an email.

The food in the resturaunts is horrible and overpriced compared to other local places.

The rooms are filthy; I had dead mosquitos and flys on the walls of the room, the bathroom metal is rusty and the bedsheets/ towels were stained.

Do not be fooled by images, if your looking for a beach holiday don‚Äôt come to bali. All the beach‚Äôs are horrible, the images are beyond deceiving.

The only good comment I have is the staff, but even then not all of them. 

This hotel has ruined my experience of bali and I deffinately will never return.",nusa dua beach hotel and spa,Bali

 but over the years, palace club is not really worth paying more for. back in 2013 & my honeymoon in 2016 the palace club staff would welcome me at the palace lounge with complimentary drinks. 2 trips after 2016, my experience has gone down. i was not welcomed to the palace club lounge, instead was checked in normally at front desk. and i was bringing my 2 kids and immediately during check-in process the front desk told me that no kids will be allowed to have breakfast at the palace lounge. i was suprise to hear the news as i never heard such ruling here.  

the palace club room has always been the best, but not this time :(, room is very clean indeed but our veranda area roof was leaking, the shower selector was broken, the bath tub pipe nozzle was falling off.

It fulfilled our desire to stay in a beautiful location right on the beach, with lovely huge pools, delightful staff and big rooms which were clean and very comfortable. The hotel is quite dated now, probably pushing a 4 star, but the price reflects that. We are paying more than double for our next hotel, which is a true 5 star, so it fits the bill perfectly for a great location, service etc on a budget.

Matt,"6,7",24 Jul 2022,"Primebiz worked out well. Around 10 minutes each way to the airport, and the hotel organised a car ($5). This road is becoming quite busy, and rooms at the front of the hotel (low numbers) and on the outer-face (even numbers) get significant traffic noise for much of the day and night. 

The footpaths were being rebuilt during my two stays, and a walk in either direction was hazardous. Contrary to some of the marketing, there are few nearby shopping and eating locations. There are always taxis on hand, but that was not my point in booking a hotel for location. 

Very friendly staff, still geeting the hang of their hotel, but always eager to please. Nice, airy, comfortable lobby. Roof-pool is clean and just big enough to stretch out, but there is no shade. Breakfast is very average.",primebiz hotel kuta,Bali

HADY,"7,3",28 Dec 2022,"Nice room , quite big compare with other budget hotel around and with budget price. They have a long bench and a table for work. even the aircon direct to the working place. They also provide fridge at room, its nice.
They also provide breakfast. The quality of their breakfast was quite varieties and they changed it every day. even the resto staff look very new and not well trained for manner. They can passed by in front of you when u want to took a glass and they also liked to stand together and talked.
For the room service, quite okay, just sometimes they forget the bathmat , but when we asked they respond.",primebiz hotel kuta,Bali

Daniela,"10,0",14 Oct 2022,"Everything is very clean, the staff is very friendly and sooo helpful!!! The airport lost my suitcase and without the help of the help of the staff I would be still waiting for my suitcase! The pool is also very nice and clean and you have a nice view over Kuta.
Kuta isn't the best city to stay but the hotel is doing there very best to make it as nice as possible! :))
We had a very nice time in the Primebiz Kuta Hotel! Thank you :)",primebiz hotel kuta,Bali

Myriam,"9,7",10 Jun 2022,"This new hotel is a 10min ride from the airport - great rooms and magnificent swimming pool on the roof. We truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and had opted for this new one because of the many positive reviews and not to be stuck in traffic in Kuta when having an international flight to catch. This hotel is worth a 5 star (building, facilities, etc.)// absolutely money for value - strongly recommended!!!!",primebiz hotel kuta,Bali
